One Two Three Four Five

Dear reader,

This is Ruben's first ever Git commit. The day is August 9, 2017. He is very excited to jump into the world of programming. People say joining GitHub is one of the most important things in the beginning of his quest. So here he is, naively writing a readme document as the GitHub beginner guide tells him to. Oh, what a noob!

He's very excited to move on through his journey in the world of code, hoping to meet friendly people along the way. Ruben gives you his warmest greetings.

Sincerely,
A guy who refers to himself in third person.
